    bio: Namrata Vaswani received a B.Tech. from the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT-Delhi)](http://www.iitd.ernet.in/deptt/ee/), in 1999 and a Ph.D. from the [University of Maryland, College Park](http://www.ece.umd.edu/), in 2004, both in Electrical Engineering. During 2004-05, she was a postdoc and research scientist at Georgia Tech. Since Fall 2005, she has been with the [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu/) where she is currently a Professor of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.iastate.edu/). She also holds a courtesy appointment in Mathematics. Her research interests lie at the intersection of data science and machine learning for high dimensional problems, signal and information processing, and computer vision and bio-imaging. Her most recent work has been on provably correct and practically useful algorithms for correlated-PCA, dynamic robust PCA and dynamic compressive sensing.
 
Prof. Vaswani has served one term as an [Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing](http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/publications/periodicals/tsp/) (2009-2012). She is a recipient of the Harpole-Pentair Assistant Professorship at Iowa State (2008-09), the Iowa State Early Career Engineering Faculty Research Award (2014) and the [IEEE Signal Processing Society Best Paper Award](http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/awards-fellows/awardspage/best-paper/) (2014) for her [Modified-CS paper](http://www.ece.iastate.edu/~namrata/modcsjournal.pdf) (IEEE Trans. Sig. Proc. 2010).
